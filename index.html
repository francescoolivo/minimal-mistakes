<p>Hello there!</p>

<p>I'm Francesco Olivo, a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Bologna.</p>

<p>Here you can find all my project and articles.</p>

<p>I mostly write about data science and data science in sports, but when I feel particularly brave I try to write about Italian politics and recent news.</p>
