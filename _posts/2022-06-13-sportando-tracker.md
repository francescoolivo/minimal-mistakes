Hello there! As the end of most leagues approaches, the market phase is starting to get hot. Here in Italy there is a
[website](https://sportando.basketball) that writes about all possible trades or signs, mostly by citing the local newspaper that got the insight first.


Since I am curious to know how accurate they are, I created a small Shiny application to track all the insights they report,
and eventually in september see how many were correct. I used all the rumors in the website and ignored articles that mention
that many teams are interested in a particular player.

The tracker consider also European basketball, and I will try to add new filters and features in the next weeks.

A colored box means that the insight is now official, a grey box is either a wrong or unofficial insight. I will do my best to
update is as often as I can.

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!
