Welcome back! In the first chapter we analyzed briefly the main requirements. Today we will go deeper, so to design the crawler in the best way.

## Requirements

Let's start from some considerations: right now there are two main use cases, the download from the leagues' websites and the upload of locally saved data.

Now, a naming clarification: there are download formats (or data formats), which are the ways we want to store data, such as SQL or data frames. Then there are requests formats, that indicate which kind of data to download, for instance players statistics, play-by-play logs, or games box-scores. Finally, there are requests filters, which allow specifying additional details to the request, such as the season or the team.

As you can imagine, there are dozens of different request types, and embedding all of them in the code would be impossible. Moreover, we must consider how different data types have different goals: SQL databases allow complex queries but a bounded structure, while dataframes offer immediateness.

Thus said, different data formats are most suited for different request types. Since all statistics are computed starting from play-by-play logs, in the SQL case only play-by-play will be allowed as request type. This may seem a bit excessive, but is based on the idea that a database will be reused for different queries, and storing data in the same format will eventually be more practical.

Data frames, on the other hand, given their flexibility, will allow all request formats. Of course, since not all leagues have advanced APIs, in some cases fetching complex information will be time-consuming, since data must be downloaded integrally and later transformed.

| FR8            | Request types should allow as many filters as possible                                                | Functional     |

Since csv files can be easily obtained from data frames, I did not include csv in the allowed data formats.

Therefore, there are three main use cases:
1. download to sql
2. download to dataframe
3. load from sql
