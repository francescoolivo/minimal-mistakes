Welcome back! I apologise for the long absence, but a few months ago I landed a new job, as I became the data analyst for Virtus Bologna.

This was one of my biggest dreams, and it's taking me plenty of time, but I'll get back to the job in another article in the next months.

This premise is nonetheless necessary to explain how I got the idea for this post. After every round of both Euroleague and Serie A, our head coach wants a report telling how does every team rank in every stat.

You should know that in Serie A there is a team, Varese, whose GM is Luis Scola, who this summer hired as head coach Matt Brase, who had a long and successful career in the G-League with the Rio Grande Vipers. This coach has a "run & gun" philosophy which is not characteristic of our league, so it's drawing a lot of attention.

Well, a few days ago I was writing the ranking report when I noticed that Varese eventually reached the threshold of 80 possessions per 40 minutes, after gradually increasing its pace during the season.

Just in case you forgot, I remind you that the number of possessions in a game are computed as the sum of:
- Field goals
- Ending possession free throws (2/2 or 3/3)
- Turnovers

To which are subtracted:
- Offensive rebounds
- Turnover which don't end a possession, such as an offensive foul while a teammate already shot

This made me wonder how do other teams across the world play, is this pace normal for other leagues or is it something special across all Europe, not only Italy?

I investigated, and it turns out that they are something _really_ special. Nonetheless, it's not the only interesting thing I learned, so here are some considerations.

As the plots shows, Varese is playing at a faster pace than _75% of the NBA teams_. Let me repeat.

_75% OF THE NBA TEAMS_

I hope it's clear now. Anyway, it turns out that they are not alone in Europe. Paris too runs a lot, both in Pro Elite and in Eurocup, which is even harder if you consider that they play much more. Also, even if you don't see them as a point in the plot, Hapoel Jerusalem and Ludwigsburg in BCL play more or less 80 possessions per game.

Interestingly, 3 out of these 4 teams have an American coach.

It also shows the incredible difference across leagues. To European Basketball fans, it's no surprise to find Euroleague at the bottom of the list,
