<p>Hi, I'm Francesco. I was born in 1999 in Bologna, in northern Italy.</p>

<p>I have always been a math guy, but when in high school I started uploading all my grades in an Excel file, looking for patterns and insights, I understood that I am a pathological case. Hence, I decided to try to make a living out of my passion, and here I am, with a BS in Computer Science Engineering, studying for a Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bologna.</p>

<p>My main focus is on machine learning and data science in sports, but I honestly love everything AI-related. I aspire to be a complete data scientist, and I'm eager to learn everything that will help me to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>One of my hobbies is to collect books, articles, and papers in my <i>to read</i> list, which I am constantly struggling to keep up with. Nonetheless, there are way too many interesting stuff and skills out there, and my goal is to grasp something new every day</p>

<p>In summer '22, I joined Virtus Bologna technical staff in the Data Analyst position. This reduced the amount of time I can dedicate to this blog, and also the topics I can cover, but I'm doing my best to keep it updated.</p>

<p>If you like what I post you can send me a mail at the address on the left, I promise to get back shortly. In case you are looking for a more complete description of my background, here is my <a href="/assets/pdfs/Olivo_Francesco_resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
