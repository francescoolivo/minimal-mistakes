RicettApp is an Android cookbook. It was developed as a work project for the Software Engineering course. The app is written in Java and Kotlin, but it's none other that a small prototype.

The goal of the project, in fact, was not the code itself, but the underlying design, following all the best design principles and patterns. You can find the detailed report <a href="/assets/pdfs/Ricettapp.pdf">here</a> (in Italian only).
